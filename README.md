CSS Foundations – Tasks Overview

This project explores the fundamentals of CSS through a series of structured tasks. The goal is to progressively build styling skills—from basic styling to positioning, responsiveness, and more advanced CSS rules.

Task 1: Some Early Styling

In this task, two CSS files were introduced:

base.css – Contains the pre-existing simple default styles provided for the project.

style.css – Contains custom styles written during the task.

Both CSS files were correctly linked to:

index.html

tweets.html

This task focused on understanding how to link external stylesheets and apply basic styling across multiple pages.

Task 2: Positioning

This task focused on mastering CSS layout positioning techniques, including:

Relative and absolute positioning

Fixed and sticky positioning

Controlling how elements appear in relation to one another

Understanding stacking contexts using z-index

The task demonstrated how CSS positioning affects layout and flow on a webpage.

Task 3: Responsive Web Design

This task introduced the foundational concepts of building responsive websites, including:

Using media queries

Implementing flexible layouts

Ensuring proper scaling across various screen sizes

Improving accessibility and usability on mobile devices

The goal was to ensure the webpage adjusts smoothly between mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Task 4: Some More Styling

This final task built on earlier lessons, introducing additional styling techniques such as:

Advanced selectors

Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements

Refining layouts for improved visual structure

Enhancing user interaction and page readability

This helped improve the overall look and feel of the project using more refined CSS rules.

Summary

Across these four tasks, the project demonstrated a strong understanding of:

Linking and managing multiple CSS files

Using CSS positioning for layout control

Making webpages responsive

Applying more advanced styling techniques

This forms a solid foundation for more advanced frontend development.
