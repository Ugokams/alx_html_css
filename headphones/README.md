📄 Responsive Web Page — Project README

Welcome to my Responsive Web Page project!
This project is built from scratch without any external libraries, using only HTML, CSS, and best practices in responsive design, accessibility, and UI consistency. The goal was to recreate a designer’s layout as closely as possible, while ensuring the page remains functional and visually appealing across all devices.

🚀 Project Overview

The objective of this project was to produce a fully functional and responsive webpage that matches a given Figma design precisely.
All structure, styles, and interactions were hand-crafted, fulfilling the following key requirements:

✔ Core Features Implemented

Pixel-accurate layout recreation based on the Figma file

Responsive behavior

Automatic mobile layout when screen width ≤ 480px

Hover/active states

Links: #FF6565

Buttons: opacity reduced to 0.9

Content container

Maximum width: 1000px, centered on the page

Typography

Designer fonts used:

Source Sans Pro

Spin-Cycle-OT

Accessible HTML structure

Semantic tags

Descriptive alt text

Logical heading order

Sufficient color contrast

🧱 Technologies Used

HTML5 — Semantic, clean, accessible structure

CSS3 — Responsive layout, typography, animations, and interactions

Media Queries — Dynamic layout switching for mobile view

Figma — Interface reference and design interpretation

📱 Responsive Layout

The page layout dynamically adjusts for:

Desktop view — Full design with wide layout

Mobile view (≤ 480px) —

Reorganized sections

Adjusted spacing

Stacked elements

Optimized typography for small screens

Responsive design techniques used:

Flexbox

Relative units (%, rem, vh, vw)

Mobile-first modifications

Adaptive images and buttons

🎨 Interactions

To improve user experience:

🔗 Links

Hover/active color: #FF6565

🔘 Buttons

Smooth hover effect

Hover/active opacity: 0.9

📝 Design Notes

Figma sometimes uses decimal values like 17.23px; these were rounded to the nearest pixel for practicality.

Spacing and alignment were handled using flexbox to ensure consistent layout behavior.

Images and backgrounds were optimized for responsive scaling.

📌 What I Learned

During this project, I strengthened my skills in:

Converting Figma design → real HTML/CSS interface

Building mobile-responsive layouts without libraries

Semantic and accessible HTML writing

Managing hover/active interactions

Using custom fonts effectively

Creating clean, maintainable, and scalable CSS
